I have installed the VScode in my previous class, so I dont have to install that again, but we can go to the website [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

I have to look up my account and reset my password on the website [Link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php), then I can log in to the server.After I logged in , it showed I logged into ieng6-203.ucsd.edu, I believe it is a server. And it also told me how many percent of the CPU I am using. It also showed the “Cluster Status”, I believe these are different servers of the connection, and it also showed the Users,Load,Averages, which means the load of CPU usage.

Then I type “cd ..”, it showed me “cs15lwi22:2$”, I think it is part of our username.
