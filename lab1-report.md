# 1.Setting up VScode:

I have installed the VScode in my previous class, so I dont have to install that again, but we can go to the website [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

# 2.Remotely Connecting:

I have to look up my account and reset my password on the website [https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php), then I can log in to the server.After I logged in , it showed I logged into ieng6-203.ucsd.edu, I believe it is a server. And it also told me how many percent of the CPU I am using. It also showed the “Cluster Status”, I believe these are different servers of the connection, and it also showed the Users,Load,Averages, which means the load of CPU usage.

# 3.Trying Some Commands:

Then I type “cd ..”, it showed me “cs15lwi22:2$”, I think it is part of our username.

# 4.Moving Files with scp:

I created a java file on my own computer called "whereAmI.java", then I use scp to copy the file to the server. Then I log in to my account to check if the file exists. I saw the file existing on the server.

# 5.Setting an SSH key:

I followed the instructions for window in powershell.

Then I followed the instructions and type the command in VScode, Then I can do ssh and scp without entering my passport.

# 6.Optimizing Remote Running:

I tried few command to make remote running, and I also use semicolons to run multiple commands on the same line. I tried 10 commands including all typing, the total time will be 3mins.
